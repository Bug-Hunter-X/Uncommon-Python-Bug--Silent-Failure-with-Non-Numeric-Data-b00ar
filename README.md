This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Python function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers. The function correctly handles empty lists, returning 0 in such cases. However, it does not explicitly check for non-numeric data types within the input list.  This oversight can lead to a `TypeError` exception if the list contains strings or other non-numeric values. The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.py` offers a robust solution that checks for and handles non-numeric data appropriately, providing more reliable average calculation.
